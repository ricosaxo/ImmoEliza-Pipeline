- Be able to install & run Airflow in a local environment and using Docker.

## The Mission
After your ImmoEliza project, the is quite happy with the results and wants to implement your solution at the company level. As they are growing, they are interested in gathering historical data of the housing market in an automated way. The company asks your team to develop a pipeline to automate their work.

    - Repo Manager: Creates and manages the repo
    - Presenter:  Communicates findings 
3. Identify technical challenges: How?
    - Who's code will be use as the main code base?
    - Create a list of tasks and assign them to team members
    - Discuss a proposed workflow (inputs/outputs) and how you will communicate as a team
4. Create the repository
    - Decide: branches or folders?
    - Decide: Github workflow
    

6. Create a DAG for each section of the pipeline
7. Test your pipeline  by running it inside a Docker container
8. Finalize your repo, README, and present results

## Deliverables

1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.
2. Pimp up the README file:
   - Description
   - Installation
   - Usage
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **DATA SOURCES**
